                    <h2>About the event and site</h2>
                    <p>It's September 23, 2011. Hundreds of people from the MIT community are participating in an annual event to document every aspect of a single day in photographs. ADITL.mit.edu is a collective photo blog of sorts, and is the repository for these photographs.</p>
                    <p>ADITL is sponsored by <a href="http://technique.mit.edu/">Technique</a>, the yearbook, photography &amp; design club of MIT. Questions and comments should be sent to <a href="mailto:aditl@mit.edu">aditl@mit.edu</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Ground rules for September 22nd</h2>
                    <p>Make sure the date and time on your camera are set correctly! We will use the timestamp embedded in the JPG file throughout the website.</p>
                    <p>Set your camera to take JPG photos (as opposed to TIF or RAW) of at least 1 megapixel. If you're a purist and must use TIF or RAW formats, please convert them to JPG before submitting photos (and PLEASE make sure that whatever you use to do the conversion preserves the EXIF tags--you can check this on our test page).</p>
                    <p>We cannot accept digital images in a format other than JPG, those that have missing or incorrect timestamps, or those not taken on September 22, 2011. So please double check everything.</p>
                    <p>There's no specific upper bound on the resolution of images you submit (we'll just resize them), however, please avoid uploading images in excess of <strong>5GB</strong>. We're not Google.</p>
                    <p>We reserve the right to reject any images based on inappropriate content.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Use of photographs after ADITL</h2>
                    <p>By using this site, your photographs become eligible for print in the ADITL spread for the <em>2012 Technique</em>, MIT's yearbook. All photographs displayed on this site are copyright &copy 2011 by the photographers who submitted them.</p>
