<p><b>
* Are there any restrictions on the pictures I can submit?
</b></p>

<p>
The pictures you submit must have been taken on September 24, 2009 only.
That is, anytime between the start of September 24 at midnight to 
the end of September 24 the following midnight.</p> 
<p>Your digital camera must have a clock, and the clock must be set correctly. The reason for this is that
the website will take advantage of the embedded EXIF timestamps in the pictures
you take. We will provide a test page where you can verify that your camera's
clock is set correctly. We also ask that you set your camera to take pictures
as JPGs, as opposed to TIF or RAW format if your camera can do that (advanced: feel free to shoot in RAW and send us conveted JPGs). Don't worry,
we'll remind you again of these requirements via email before the event.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, there are no restrictions. Take pictures of anything, 
in any way you want during those 24 hours. And by anything, we mean things that aren't in ridiculous bad taste or are illegal.
</p>

<p> <b>
* But I'm not a good photographer!
</b></p>

<p>
We're not looking for "artsy" photography. We want to know
how you spend your day. Everyone's daily life is unique,
and we want to get as many points of view as possible.
Don't worry about it!  Oh yeah, but if you want to submit
"artsy" photography, that's fine too.
</p>

<p><b>
* I don't have time!
</b></p>

<p>
We're not asking you to go out of your
way to take pictures. Just carry your camera around with
you, and occasionally pull it out and shoot a picture.
Whether you're in class, or walking down the infinite, or at
lunch, or on the toilet, or laying in bed watching tv.
</p>

<p><b>
* Do I have to use a digital camera? Can I submit film?
</b></p>

<p>
If you are willing to have your film developed and then scanned digitally, and then submit the JPGs, we wholeheartedly endorse your use of film.  Even though Technique is a film-loving group, sadly, for this project, we can only accept digital or digified film.
</p>
<!-- <p>
The ADITL web site depends on knowing when you took your pictures. If you're willing to
keep an accurate account of when you took pictures throughout the day <b>and</b> are willing to scan
your film and submit the scans, then we'll be happy to accept your submission. We cannot accept developed or
undeveloped film (we tried this last time--it didn't work); you must scan your film yourself and submit the scans. If you're interested 
in this, contact aditl@mit.edu. You'll still need to register. Mad props if you go this route and use a Holga or Lomo.
